# Overview

### Figure 1. 
Root mean squared error (RMSE) of (a) soil moisture at 20 cm depth and (b) surface sensible heat fluxes for different baselines at 1-, 2-, and 4-degree resolution for 1- and 5-day lead time

### Figure 2. 
Global soil moisture (m3/m3) of ERA5-land and various DL predictive models at
1-degree resolution. The top row depicts the ERA5-Land ‘truth’ fields for layer 1 (0-7 cm) with
1- and 5-day lead times. The other predictive models are the CNN (second row), ConvLSTM
(third row), LSTM with 7-timestep (fourth row), and LSTM with 365-timestep (last row). The
red words on the graph indicate the median performance of each model in the test set. Note that
only the results of one random day (135-th) in 2020 were used for verification.

### Figure 3. 
Same as Fig. 2 but for global surface sensible heat fluxes (J/m2).
