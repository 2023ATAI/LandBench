# Overview

### Why use LandBench?

The advancements in deep learning methods have presented new opportunities and challenges for predicting **land surface variables (LSVs)** due to their similarity with computer sciences tasks.

However, the lack of a benchmark dataset hampers fair comparisons of different data-driven deep learning models for LSVs predictions. 

Hence, we propose a LSVs benchmark dataset and prediction toolbox to boost research in data-driven LSVs modeling and improve the consistency of data-driven deep learning models for LSVs.
