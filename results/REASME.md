# Overview

### Figure 1. 
Root mean squared error (RMSE) of (a) soil moisture at 20 cm depth and (b) surface sensible heat fluxes for different baselines at 1-, 2-, and 4-degree resolution for 1- and 5-day lead time

### Figure 2. 
Global soil moisture (m3/m3) of ERA5-land and various DL predictive models at
1-degree resolution. The top row depicts the ERA5-Land ‘truth’ fields for layer 1 (0-7 cm) with
1- and 5-day lead times. The other predictive models are the CNN (second row), ConvLSTM
(third row), LSTM with 7-timestep (fourth row), and LSTM with 365-timestep (last row). The
red words on the graph indicate the median performance of each model in the test set. Note that
only the results of one random day (135-th) in 2020 were used for verification.

### Figure 3. 
Same as Fig. 2 but for global surface sensible heat fluxes (J/m2).

### Figure 4. 
The predictive performance of different DL predictive models for soil moisture and
sensible heat flux at a spatial distribution of 1-degree and a 1-day lead time, measured by RMSE, R, and bias. Results for each variable are presented in the top row for CNN model, the
subsequent two rows for ConvLSTM and LSTM with a 7-timestep models, respectively, and the
final row for LSTM with a 365-timestep model.

### Figure 5. 
(a) Randomly selected grids on the global map and (b-f) one-year time series of soil
moisture in different grids. The time series were generated with 1-day lead time using the LSTM
with a 365-timestep model (perform the best among all DL models) and processed-based model.

### Figure 6. 
Same as Fig. 5 but for global surface sensible heat fluxes (J/m2).
